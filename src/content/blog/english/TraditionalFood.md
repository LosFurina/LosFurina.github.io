When it comes to my favorite food for tradition festivals, I'd like talk about is Traditional Chinese Rice-pudding.

This is a famous food that merely all of people in China'll make and eat in Dragon Boat Festival including me. It is believed that this pudding is for commemorating a famous ancient patriotic poet Quyuan who suicide by jumping into the river since his country has been occupied by the enemy, this is a sort of custom that throwing the rice-pudding to the river to protect this poet from eating by the fish. This might be a story, we now just eating this rice-pudding for celebrating the festival.

Regard to the method of making this pudding, we'll prepare some sticky rice, this is just a kind of rice which can be shaped more easily, besides, we also need some bamboo leaves for wrapping the rice. After wrapping the rice with leaves, we just put them into boiled water until cooked. It sounds easily, but I have made it in person, although the sticky rice is more easily to shape, it still hard to make it looked pretty. So, for us general family, we now just buy some Traditional Chinese Rice-pudding from the store.

As for me, I really enjoy this food, just because I am a sweet-tooth, and in north of China, this kind pudding will be ate with dipping sugar, it taste so sweet. But the case in south of China is different, pudding is cooking with salt and meat, so it tatse saulty, i am not into this version.
