# QA Outline

## 1. Past: Learning and Practice

### 1.1 Learning Experience

One of the most meaningful courses for me was Java programming. It helped me understand how to build an application end to end and gave me a clearer view of software engineering fundamentals.

### 1.2 Internship / Project Practice

I worked on practical engineering tasks including debugging, automation scripts, and project delivery support. This experience improved my problem-solving workflow and communication in technical collaboration.

## 2. Present: Current Focus

- I am currently focused on cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and Linux operations.
- I am improving both technical depth and communication in English.
- I am preparing for DevOps / Infrastructure intern opportunities.

## 3. Future: Career Direction

My short-term goal is to join an engineering team as a DevOps intern and contribute to automation and reliability improvements. In the long term, I want to grow into an infrastructure engineer who can design stable delivery pipelines and production-ready systems.
