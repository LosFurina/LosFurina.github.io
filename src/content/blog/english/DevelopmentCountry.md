# Title

**Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.**

# Practice

Regrading to the purpose for the development of a country, there are some disputes among the different groups of people. On the one hand, some people think achiving the economy growth is much more important. On the other hand, some of them reckon that there are also many other aspects are as matter as the economy increase. In moy opinion, I am of the point that although it is essential for the development of a country, those other sides related to people's life should be paied more attention to.

First of all, it is reasonable that some people support the government to focus on the stimulating of economy, because the revenue is essentially important for developing other aspects of one country. If a country have no enough funding, it is imangable that people's livehood could poor. For example, the development of a city must be relied on the fundamental facilities including express way, transportation and buildings, but If there is no sufficient budget of local government, it will be impossible to improve those basic conditions. Besides, there are also many benefits that people can get from the increasing economy. For instance, there will be more job opportunities for people to select, and people can earn money easily from the local companies sinse the government own enough money to invest those local industials. It is exact that people can improve their life quality.

On the other hands, it is also comprehensiable that economy development is not everything, there are still some aspects can be easily overlooked, such as social justice, people's safety and national culture. People can gain a sense of acceptance and belief from the actions of the government to make sure they can be treated equally. Only the boosting of the economy can not bring those benefits to people, it needs the efforts from governments. Additionally, with the development of one country, the environmental pollution is also a big challenge to face. For example, New York, Beijing and London are polluted as the developed industries near the downtown. It is inevitable people will be affected by poor air condition, a lot of people living here will get some disease, as the result, people will have no energy to work even move out off this city, in that case, the economy will not increase anymore.

Overall, although the increase of economy is essentially important for a country, while administrators should not underrestimate the importance of those detailed aspests which can affect people's life. Essentially, people are the basis for the development of a country. Therefore, this is not just a binary issue, we should have a balance development on multi-sides.
