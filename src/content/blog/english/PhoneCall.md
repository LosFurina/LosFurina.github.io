## Practice

When it comes to phone calls from someone I don't know, I'd like to say, there are so many examples to talk about.

Not only I can but also merely all of people in China will receive some phone calls from the unknown, no matter where they are or when it is including listening lectures at classroom, studying in library and walking alongside the road. This phenomenon is so general, we call this <span style="color: red">Spam phone calls</span>.

Sometimes, we could receive that kinds of phone calls from some commercial companies, such as telecom companies, insurance conpanies even some educational companies. The purpose of thoes kinds of phone calls are similar, that is marketing their products or their service. Those salemans absolutely prepared well for their advertisement and speaking, like, they'll say, our products are so cheap that I can get much benefit from their products.

Just take an example of me, I once received a unknown phone call from telecom company, she told me I could change a plan of my calling card, the charge will be more expansive but I also could get some extra service, including the VIP service of a famous video website in China. At that time, I was walking with my friends on the street, I hadn't think it through but admit her.  Next month, I found an extra bill of my phone, but that VIP service had not work, I call the staff and got that I needed to activate this service by myself. I have missed that extra service with extra bill and had no any notes for activating. I was so annoied but I can do nothing, so I canceled all of services of that telecom company.
