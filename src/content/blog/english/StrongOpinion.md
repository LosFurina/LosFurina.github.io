## Practice

When it comes to a person who has strong opinions, the first one that comes up from my mind must be my university roommate. After we entered the university we met each other at out domitory.

Then we started the university life, we had been close friends, we went to classroom and finished our homework together. From then on, we were not only the roommates but also teammates, which means we done those teamwork together. Why I'd like talk about him as an opinionated person is because he seldom accepted my advice, and always inststed himself. For example, currently, just about 3 months ago, we were all busy with our own graduation design, and we were in the same research group. You know, he just started from scratch, but I started my research work earlier than my classmates, so he usually asked me some questions about how to do on research work, because I had already finished reproduction of him experiment. So I really could help him a bit. I told him to rewrite the code of that project, at least to improve that, just making experiment results saved automatically, so that he could analysised the result easily. But after I gave him advices, he still reckoned that he can manage those experiment result well, but unfortunately, when it came to the end of deadline, our mentor told he should re-generate the figure of his resulte data because his figure was a little vague, but at that time, it's really hard to collect all the data together again and make a new figure. Finally, he had no choice but accepted a lower score.

Just from my saw, these sorts of strong opinion is absolutely not a good habit, and exactly he got some bad consequence. He had never suffered those difficulties in person must be the main point for him to insist his own opinion. Although we were the close friends, I have to say he's a bit **big headed**.
