## Practice

When it comes to a person who really enjoy reading book, the first one that I'd like to talk about must be my best friend.

We have known each other for so long, since we were studying ar primary school, until now, it's approximately at leat 10 years.

Regarding to the kinds of books that he likes to read, that must be history-related books and biography. To speak of, I am also fond of history, so we always have similar interests and topic to talk about, that's must be the main point that we have been best friends for so long. As I remembered, he always talked those famous people around the world, especially the  presidents of some strong countries like the US, UK. When we were young, we just talked about those interesting plot of history story and what the famous people have done for his or her nation and how they achieve the success on their career. We just adored them for their brilliant achievement. But now, we focus more on talking about ourselves understanding on those people or events described on the books, often we argue to convince each other.

As friends, I believe his passion for history-related books is the main driving force. Besides, although we both like reading history events, he prefer regarding those successful men as guidelines and try his best to simulate their behaviors, but believe'd or not, the majority of history described on books are not real, I don't trust the history on books, the reason for me to read those books is just protecting myself from being cheated by those deceites.
