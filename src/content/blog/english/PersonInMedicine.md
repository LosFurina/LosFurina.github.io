## Practice

When it comes to a person who are in medience-wise career, I'd say it a little hard for me to find one to talk, because I'm still a student, and the people around me are also students. We all haven't step into careers.

But there is exactly a person that I remembered, after the university entrance examination, he chose his university major as clinical medicine, he is my team leader in senior high school.

Although we were not the best friends, I still reckon that he was really a good person for me, at least. You know, the study in senior high school, especially in China and even in my city, the stress of studying is very heavy, we had to get up at 6 a.m. everyday and until 1 a.m. I can't fall asleep, that period was really a sort of torture. At that painful period, he gave me so much help. He was exactly a big fan of biology, but I was not interested in that subject, so, for getting a decent score in examination I asked him a lot of question on biology. He alwasy explained the basic knowledge clearly for me. 

Besides, why I remember him so deeply not just for his help on study, you know at that time, I was usually laughed at by the master teacher in my class and some classmates with bad intentions for some weird reasons such as the poor score in final term examination or just because of some freckles on my face. He was the only person comforted me and took me easy, you know I hated those people so much at that time, I absolutely ani't focused on my school work, the emotion of me was really so bad.

In sights of those factors, I really have immense respect and gratitude to him, without him, I even not sure whether I cuould go through that dark period.

Regarding to the why he chose the clinical medicine, I'm not sure the concrete reasons, but studying for 3 years, I guess, first of all, is he is really good at biology, maybe it will be easy for him to study the knowledge of medicine, these two subjects are similar. What's more, current years, being a doctor must be a good choice to find a high-salary job, and there're exactly more job opportunities in medical field that any other unpopular major.
