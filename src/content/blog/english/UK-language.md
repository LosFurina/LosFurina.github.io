It is obvious that the number of students who studied Spanish as their second language were the most in both 2000 and 2010, and who can speak German only were the least in both 2000 and 2010. Besides, Spanish and another language became more popular from 2000 to 2010, the distribution of other four parts are keeping stable or even less.

## <span style="color:orange">Overall view</span>

In 2000, the table shows that Spanish was learned by the most students in this university, which is around 30%. In addition, 20% of students in this university cannot speak a second language except English. It is eaqual for the number of students speaking Franch and other language not mentioned at this research, which is about 15%. Finally, the proporation of those who regarded German as their second language and who are able to speak more than two different foreign language are the smallest.

In 2010, the situation remained similar to that of 2000. **Spanish continued to be the most popular foreign language, with a 5% increase** in its usage. **The same trend was observed in the proportion of students speaking a language other than those mentioned in this research, which also increased by 5%.** Additionally, the percentage of students who chose to learn German and those who could speak at least two different foreign languages remained at one-tenth. **It is worth noting that the number of students speaking a different language saw** a dramatic decrease, from 20% to 10%, over the course of these ten years. Furthermore, the usage of the other two languages also decreased, with a 5% decline.
