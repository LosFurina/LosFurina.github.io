When't comes to my favorite public park, I'd like to talk about is the one located in my hometown, which is Wuhai Lake Park. It's next to the yellow river and locates at west of the whole city, but it'a a bit far away from downtown, so if people wanna visit or play at this park, it'll absoulutely take them some time on transportatin.

This park is free for all of visitors, and it's fomous for its huge human lake, it has been built about 10 years ago, and to speak of, there is a nisland in the center of the lake, people can go across the lake to that island by taking a boat with extra fee. Sadly, I have never get that island so far. If it possible, I really wanna have a visit of that island.

When I was studying at senior high school, I usually went that park with my friends about once a week. Not only just for relaxation, but also we could study at a cafe in that park. The air condition is good and what's more, there merely is no noise, so we could enjoy that time and pay full attentin to study. Sometimes, we also went that park at night, becaure I had a astronomical telescope, we could observe the stars using that telescope. It is excatly interesting, and I'm really nostalgic for that period playing with my friends since now we really have no enough time to play together.
