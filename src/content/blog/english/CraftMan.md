## Practice

When it comes to a person who enjoy making some stuffs by hands, there is exactly a person that I'd like to talk about.

He is an internet influencer in China, his nickname is "He tongxue", which means "classmate He", his last name might be He, and you know, there are a lot of followers of him including domestice platform bilibili and some international platform, including twitter and Youtube, at least, he has approximately 100,000 followers.

The first time that I know him is from a video made by him on that domestice video platform. He focused on making some gadgets by hands and published the processing of manufacturing on those video platforms.

What impresses me most is a high technology desk maked by himself. 
The original purpose for making this desk is to implement a ideal product that have been canceld by Apple, that is AirPower, a stuff for wireless charging. Therefore, we will never buy it from Apple, the only way is making it by himself. This influencer wanna make a better AirPower than that idea of Apple. 

First of all, this desk has a height-adjustable desk legs, which can adjust different using scenarios. In order to realize wireless charging on desk, him came up a new idae, that is, when we put the phone on the desk, the wireless charging plate will move to the below of the phone automatically with a computer vision technology. Besides the wireless charging, he also integrated some else functions to this desk, like there is a mini robat that can help us pick up a glass of water, and there is also a LED screen can show some information, like time, countdown and weather. All in all, this craft is exactly interesting.

To speak of, I am a student majoring in the Computer Science, so when I saw this video, I dived into it immediately. I am really interested in how this desk work, so I watched this video thoroughly. 

Based on his previous video, I guess he is also a big fan of cutting-edge technology, particularly Apple products, which aligns with my own interests. It's as if we share a common passion, which is why I follow his account to stay updated on more captivating technology-related content.
