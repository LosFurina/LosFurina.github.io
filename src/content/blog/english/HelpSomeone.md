**Describe an occasion when you helped a family member/relative with something
You should say:
When it happened
Who you helped
How you helped
And explain how you felt about the experience**

## Practice

When it comes to an occasion that how I help a relative of my, the first one that I'd like to talk about must be my cousin. When we were young, we studied at same primary schoold, junior high schoold and senoir high school together. And at time, we always helped each other on study, you know, we are not just relatives but also best friends. After finished the university entrance examination, we chose the differnet major and then, we had to go to the different universities. Since then, we merely have no chance to meet face to face.

Just few months ago, we were all focused on our own graduation design, but she met some problems that can't solved by herself and even can't solved by people around her. So she contacted me through Wechat, you know that is a communication internet platform in China. What she were doing is about adademic research, inevitablely, she had to use google earth and google scholar. But out of some unspeakable reasons, people living in China can't access the services from google, you know. To speak of, her major is geology it is merely impossible to access the websites like goole in China without the help of people who know the way, and it just so happens that I was also doing academic research, I knew clearly why we can't access google and how to access google.

However, just talking on the communication platform is not convenient, because I can't see her screen, and don't know what she have done, so finally, we find a application that allow me to control her PC, and I operate her PC in person and help her computer to access google and Youtube etc.

Honestly speaking, helping her get out of from the block of those unspeakable restriction and to access the google is so easy for me, but I found a general phenomena in China is the majority of people merely have no chance to access those websites even the students for academic researching. Not just those student who are not working in Computer but also some majoring in computer and internet still know nothing about they have been restricted. What I was feeling is not happy for solving the problem of my cousin, I just feel a little pathetic that they even don't care the freedom of their accessing even just Google.
