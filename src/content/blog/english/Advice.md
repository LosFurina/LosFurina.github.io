## Topic

**Describe a person from whom <span style="color:red">others</span> like to ask for advice** 
**You should say:**
**Who this person is**
**Why people like to ask for his/her advice**
**What kind of advice he/she often gives**
**And explain how you feel about the person**

## Practice

When it comes to a person that people around me often seek advice from, the first one that comes to mind is my university major mentor.

You see, my major is Computer Science. In my field, when we encounter problems, such as code that won't compile, where to find relevant information, or even when we don't know what problems we are facing, the situations can be quite strange. This is when we really need a knowledgeable person to seek advice from, and the best one is definitely our major mentor. She is experienced enough to offer us some useful suggestions. In addition, our mentor is friendly and very patient, so when we talk to her, we feel no stress and can take it easy. For these reasons, we really like seeking help from her.

Furthermore, the advice from our mentor is so detailed and professional. These problems are exactly difficult for beginners to find a correct solution, and she knows it clearly. Therefore, not just out of the responsibility as a teacher but also for taking care of us, she always provides guidance that not only addresses the immediate issue but also helps us understand the underlying principles, becaues no one can know everying, which improves our problem-solving skills over time.

As for how I feel about her, I have immense respect and gratitude. She has helped me significantly, not only with my academic research but also by making me understand that grasping the underlying principles and mechanisms of problems is more crucial than the problems themselves. Now, I am confident in facing challenges and problems without needing anyone else's help, simply by applying what I learned from my mentor.
