## Practice

When't comes to a place that we can see plenty of wildlifes, the first one that I'd like to talk about is Wuhai lake park, which is a landmark of my hometown. This park is next to the yellow river and locates at west of the whole city, but it'a a bit far away from downtown, so if people wanna visit or play at this park, it'll absoulutely take them some time on transportation.

To speak of, this park is fomous for its huge human lake, and it has been built for 10 years. The original prupoes for building this human lake is improving environment including water quality, air condition, and as a result, more and more wildlifes came and lived at here. As for now, there is a diversity of fish living in the lake. Besides, some river gulls can be seen in summer, you know, this species is very precious before the lake was built since the environment is actually bad for living. What's more, there are also some dangerous species like snakes, I have met snakes when I was a juinor high school student, me and my friends came here for camping, when we were waking alongside the rode, a snake suddenly came up, we all haven been frightened.

As the environment improved, more and more people are willing come here for some activities. Because the environment of downtown is still bad, people can get fresh air and relax themselves including me. Besides, not only we can see some beautiful wildlifes, but alse there are many entertainment facilities, such as cafe, library and cruises, we actually can have a good holiday at here.

You know I a really not a big fan of travelling, but as a resident of this city, i'm still astonished by this park for its development and I'm also pleased for the change of my city as a witness. If it possible, i'll absolutely recommand this park for my new friends in the future to come here have a vist.
