## Practice

When it comes to an untouched peroson, I'd like to talk about is my friend when we were studying at junior high school. Initically, we were not the friends, but I remembered that there was an English Speech Competition held by another school, competitors had to go that school for speeching. To speak of, I was so familar with that place since I usually went my grandma's home on weekends. Our school was a bit far away from that school, so our master teacher wished that I could went with him and help him find that school easily. Since then, we had known each other and became friends.

But, you know, when we finished the senior high school entrance examination, in order to get further study in senior school, we had to choose different school, so that we each went our own way. Gradually, we lost contact each other. You knwo, at that time, especially as a student in China, parent wouldn't allow children to use smartphone, it was hard to get in touch with through internet.

After three years later, we ended up with our senior high school study, and that's time to select our dream university, it is so happened that we chose the same university. At that time, we all had our own smartphone, and he shared his university with me through wechat, I was so astonished at that time, it is unimageable that we chose the same school. And I really can't wait to meet with him in the university. When the term began, we arrived at school and met each other immediately. At that time, what I was thinking is that that's must be a dream, we can be the best friends again with losing contact so long.
