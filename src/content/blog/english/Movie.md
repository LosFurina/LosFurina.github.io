**When't comes the topic of movie, I really have much wannt talk about. This is not just for IELTS, but also for sharing my understanding of the world i'm living.**

When' comes to a movie that I watched currently and enjoy it, I'd like talk about must be Trueman's world, as far as I know, it has another name called The Trueman Show, I know this a old movie, but it's absolutely a classic and famous one.

Because this is a old movie which has been published at least 10 years ago, so there is no chance for me to watch it at cinema, I just watched it on Netflix website at my home just a month ago.

You know I am exactly busy with my English study and adcdemic research, so there is merely no enough leisure time left for me to play with my friends. Therefore, I just watched some movies alone, including Trueman's world.

This movie is talking about a insurance staff living a life that controled by a director and and the whole life was lived for all of people in this country, even more, all of his family members are actores and actoress, the pity trueman never doubt his life was a huge lie. After he grew up, he gradually realized this world was a little weird from some actors flaws, a girl wanna tell him the truth, but unfortunately, the director stopped this mistake and kicked that girl off from this big show. But no matter how the direcotr to mix the story line, trueman finally found the entire truth of this world and finally decided out off from this huge lie and pursued him own life.

Why I enjoy this movie is not for its vision effects, but for its plot. I really can resonate with the main characteristic Trueman, because I am also living in a world like him. Sometimes, I really can't distinguash what is the true life and what is fake. Especially in China. Out of some unspeakable reasons, people living in China have no chance to know some news from other medias except those demestic media company. Besides, we even can't watch videos from YouTube, from Netflix including Trueman's world this movie, that is so ironically that I am really living in a world like Trueman's world, but fortunately, with some help of my major I can access those information on the international internet.

Initially, I watched those movies just for improving my English skills, that is I believe that the best to learn English is using English in my daily life, rather than just memorizing the spelling of words, but as I watched more movies and videos like Trueman's world, I realized that I need a further study go abroad and view this world in person.
