## Practice

When it comes to someone's room, the fist one that comes from my mind is my best friend's house, and we have been friend for about 10 years.

When we were studying at primary school, I often went to his house and play with him. His house is a bungalow, so the room is bigger the building where I live. There are about 6 rooms at his house, when I enterd the main door the first room I can see is living room, it is the biggest room, there is a whiteboard we bought together for studying, but there is no televison in this living room, you know, televison is so general in Chinese family. Go through ahead, there is dinning room, different from livning room, it is too small, we just can sit close for dinner and we can't do anything else. Besides, there are two bedrooms seperately on the right and left of dinning room. I seldom went into his parents room, it might be impolite as a guest. So I always played with my friends at him bedroom.

To speak of, there is a computer at his room, at that time, the computer is not so precious for general family, but my parents never bought one to me since they reckon I can't control myself to play game all day and night. The more they wouldn't allow me to play computer games, the more interested I became in computeres. That's why I choes the Computer Science as my university major, and the truth confirmend that I can perform well in studying with playing computer games. 

At that time, I often went to his house and play computer games with him on weekends but just for a little time. As mentioned above, we bought a whiteboard and set it at his living room, so ater the school, we always studied together with that whiteboard, we can drew some drafts and wrote some math equations to argue. On the holiday, we often called more friends coming to his house to paly board game.

You know, that period was really funny, we have no need to concern something except studying, and we could play together happily, but now, we are so busy, most my friends have to work for money or still pursue their furthe study career. And i'm also busy with my academic research and learning Engish for futher study, so I'm really nostalgic for that preiod playing and studying with my friends.
