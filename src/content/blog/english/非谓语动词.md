# 特点

除了不可以做谓语，其他句子成分均可

丧失动词的三大特性，但仍然是一种动词，同时具有了一部分名词的性质

# 非谓语动词的分类

## 动词不定式

不定时是指：不受人称和时态限制

### 做主语

To eat an apple a day is good for your health.

It is good for you to eat an apple a day.

Eating an apple a day is good for you.

### 做宾语

I like to eat apples.

I consider apples sweet.

I stop to sleep.

### 宾语补足语

I hope you can get a good score in next examination.

注意区分宾语和宾语补足语，宾语承接谓语动词发起的动作，而宾语又承接宾语补足语的动作结果或状态。

I find it easy to learn English.

### 定语

I have a lot of apple to eat.（区分定语还是宾语补足语，只需要看后面这个东西是否能）

### 状语

I was happy to get a new smartphone.(原因)

I can do my best to get a good score in next examination.(目的)

I have got enough score to enter No.1 Middle School.(结果)

## 动名词

v. + ing = 动名词，相当于名词，但同时具备动词的动作性质，但不具备那三个最重要的性质

Eating apples is healthy for the people.(主语)

My hobby is running.(表语)

Smoking is killing.

I like eating apples.

I stop sleeping.I

I forgot reviewing English words.

A writing board = A board for writing. 动名词做定语全都可以换成for···的形式

## 现在分词

主动性 - 进行态 - 具有：令人···的 - 形容词

A running dog != A dog for running,因此这里不是动名词做定语，而是现在分词做定语

The story is interesting.

The game is exciting.

The news is encouraging.

Hearing the news, I become so excited.

Knowing you haven't finished your homework, I am so disappointed.

## 过去分词

被动性 - 完成态 - 具有：自身状态的 - 形容词
