## Practice

When it comes to a challenge that I am facing, I really feel this deeply and have much wannt talk about. So I'd like talk about is applying master's degree. You know, this must be the most difficult challenge for me.

Since the March on the last yaer, I have already prepared some work of applying, until now, it has been approximately one and a half year including now. Last year, I haven't get my bachelor's degree, so I was living in my university and doing some sidework of applying such as learning English and preparing the IELTS, at that time, I had to pay more attention to my final examination, so I had no enough energy to concentrate on IELTS, I just try it once on July, but I just got 6 last time. And then, the next term began, although I was so worried that I exactly can't get enough score in IELTS, but I had to graduate first, and meanwhile, I also had to do some internship job and academic research to rich my resume and personal statement. Besides, GPA was also important for me, I must perform well on all of those I mentioned above.

In order to get a good GPA, when I was in Third year of university, I always staied up late to review my schoolwork for a good score in final examination fortunately, I finally got about 88 of GPA. But in the present viewm, get a good GPA might be tht easiest part. After I entered the fouth year of the university, I had to pay full attention on my graduation design, that is a part of my research experience. Maybe you can't image how difficult about academic research, I had to understand how the model work and reproduce the sort of the art experiment. In order to get a perfect result, I even staied up late until 5 am often. Because the experiment can't be stopped, so I had no choice but to wait, meanwhile, I studied English. When the time came to this year, I finnaly finish the academic research a few days ago.

In addition, it is necessary to get a 6.5 in IELTS, but from my saw, listening must by a shortage for me. And the tension is unavoidable for me in Speaking part. You know, after I decided to apply my master's degree, I actually have no any leisure time to have a rest, I am so tired now, and sometimes I really can't consist on.
