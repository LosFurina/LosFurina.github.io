To speak of, I am really fond of computer science and I am also a student majoring in computer science. And I exactly enjoying tinkering with some gadgets on computer.

That video is published on Youtube, you know, that is must be the most famous video platform across the world. And I have already followed that youtuber for so long. It is so happened that just a few days ago, I was learning English and writing some practice of my IELTS experience, so I wanna find a blog website to record those experience, suddenly, I found that youtuber published a video to help followers establish their own website to record something, so I entered it and watch it through. You know, I have enough knowledge about internet and code programming, so I reproduce the processing of that video rapidly.

With I knew about this blog well, I found something more interesting to play, that I can establish my own music library, which means I can get out of from the block of those music company and listen music with no charge, that feeling was really good.

Although I have not learned a new program language, I mastered a new method to build a website of myself, that's sound so cool, I even can name that website as my name. and I can visit that website just inputing my name on browser.
