## Practice

I exactly don’t go shopping so often, but when it comes to shoping, the first one that pops up from my mind is an experience of an online shopping. We should access this online store so convenient rather than going to brick and mortar stores, we can escape the long time trasnportation, just using our smart phone and taping an application is ok. That is just about 4 years ago, when I was a freshman in the university, at that time, my cell phone was so old that it might be hard to use, I decided to change one new. At first, I was a little bit worried about the quality of phone, you know, It is absolutely possible that we bought a forged cell phone, especially online shopping. So I asked so many questions to the staff of this retailer. As my expectation, the staff could be impatient, you know, this scenario is so commom when I was shopping before, but this assistant answered me all of the questions and promise me if the phone was a fake, I could cancel the order with no any loss, including post fee. Besides, I also could get a gift. This shopping experience makes me so comfortable compared to those previous. In the future, I absolutely will prioritize the online shopping, not just for convenience but also for high quality service.
