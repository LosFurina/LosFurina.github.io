**Describe something you did in your study/work that has made you feel confident
You should say:
When and where it happened
What you did                    
Why it made you feel confident      
And explain how you felt about it**

## Practice

When it comes to a work that makes me feel so confident, the first one that I'd like to talk about is a thing which also make me hard to forget. That was once teamwork.

When I was in my third year of university, there was a class called Network security and program design. You know, I am a student majoring in computer science. The teacher of this class made a homework that should be done by a team, and all of students should make their team.  That homework is designing a program which was related to network security, and meanwhile, two of classmates came to me and ask whether we could be a team, at the beginning, I was so delighted to finish this homework with a team, because I can know more classmates, and became friends with each other, so I agreeed the invitation. After a few days, all of my teammates reckon I was studied well at code programming, and recommand me to be the team leader, I also agreeed at that time. But something happened after that made me so suprised, I assign the different parts of the homewoek to thoes two, and they made sure they could finish in two week. But, after two weeks, and the homewoek deadline was closing, I asked them for their part of work, they just told me they were so busy with something else, so they had not do the homework, I was so annoied at that time. I had no choice but done all of homework by myself, and finally, I finished all brfore the deadline. You know, at that time, I even staied up late until 4 am everyday and got up at 10 am. I was so tired those day and feeling unpleaant for those two teammates.

Although, those two were so unresponsible for our team, but I found I can finish the work by myself without them evne got a A in final score, to speak of, I am really fond of computer science, so I don't think learning more is a bad thing. After I suffered that experience, I was actually confident because I knew I was energetic and powerful enough to finish my study without the help and any cooperation. Despite that I was really tired, but I was also happy to improve myself.
