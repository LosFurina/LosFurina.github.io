## Topic

**Describe a cultural place that you would like to learn the culture there (e.g. a library, museum, theatre)
You should say:
Where it is 
How you knew this place 
What it is like 
And explain how the place is related to culture**

## Practice

One cultural place I’d like to explore is the Apsaras Conference, held by Alibaba annually, a famous internet company in China. Concretely speaking, this conference is like a party for all the people who are interested in the Internet, including Artificial Intelligence and Program coding. And you know, I am a student majoring in Computer science and really wanna have further study in my master’s degree in the future. So I’m exactly into this conference. The first time I heard about it was from my friend's recommendation, and he wanna go with me last year, but I was so busy at that time, so I missed that chance.  At that conference, there will be many famous internet companies from all over the world, showing their state-of-the-art production and advanced technologies. I’d learn much about the latest techs and expand my view on my favorite field. As for why I reckon this conference is a kind of culture of this city, is because this city is full of technology vibes and as the result of some historical and geological factors, most people who are into modern and cyberpunk lifestyle would come to this city to pursue their dreams.  That’s exactly a comfortable atmosphere for me because I’m a member of them.
