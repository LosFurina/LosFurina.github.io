## Practice

When it comes to a award that I got recently, I'd like talk about must be that I got the scholarship from Zhejiang Province Goverment. To speak of, this scholarshiop is really a nhonor for student in China. You know, In my school, just about three students could receive this scholarship every year and I got this befor I graduated from my university about a few months ago.

In order to get this scholarship, there is a main precondition. That is only the student who got the first-class scholarship twice during this year could have the quality to apply this government scholarship. So the most difficult part is achieving the first-class scholarship. During this year, I studied so hard on my schoolwork in order to get a perfect GPA. Besides, I  also participated many activities to get extra bonus score to enrich my after-school experience. When the time came to the end of that term, I staied up late to review my course for a good final examination score.  Hard work pays off, I finally got first-class scholarship twich and then, I had the qualtification to apply government scholarship, you know, there are really few people can get the qualification to apply, so this phase is just writing a peroson statement and a application form.

You know, I was so confident at that time, because I confirmed that I can achieve my target If I pay enough efforts on it. And I am also happy to receive that scholarship to buy something I want.
