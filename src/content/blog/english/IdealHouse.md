## Practice

When it comes to my ideal house, there are really a lot of assumptions in my mind.
To be honest, I'd like to purchase my house located in a quiet place, which can make me escape from hustle and bustle. Because living in the urban area for over 20 years makes me tired and bored. My favourite locality is Suzhou, Jiangsu, which is young and active. I once visited this city when I was a sophomore, and I was surprised by this city. The modern and countryside life are mixed here, I can work or study in bustling downtown and live in leisure countryside. This is my dream style.

Regarding the appearance of my house, I'd like to divide my house into two levels with separate upper and lower sections, so that the area of my room will be big. The living room and kitchen will be located at lower section, while bed room, toilet and my computer room will be set at upper level. The main reason I am designing my house in this way is because dividing different function of room separately can make my house look tidy and in perfect order. Besides, my family can play or cook at lower section and I study or work at upper section, in this case, I can pay full attention to my work without any noise.

In addition, the main feature of my house is that it will be filled with high technology. Since I was a child, I was a big fan of high technology. I would like to equip my house with a kit of intelligent home systems, all chores inside the house can be finished by robots, so there is a lot of leisure time left for me to do something meaningful.
