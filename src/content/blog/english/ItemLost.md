## Practice

When it comes to an important item that I have lost, that must be a cellphone when I used diring my junior high school period.

As I memorized, one day, when I was going to have my after school classes on weekends, that interest class was so far away from my home, so I had to take bus. You know, Usually, I'd fall asleep so quickly when I was on the bus, and so do thin time. And I guess I had a good dream at that time. Until the but got the destination, I woke up with some dizzizess and got off the bus. A few minutes later, I suddenly found I had lost my cellphone on the bus, maybe when I was asleep, the cellphone slide out off from my trouser pocket. 

At that time, I was so restless and worried about where my phone is, I went back to the station I got off and found my phone anywhere, but finally, I confirmed that it had been lost.

To speak of, just talking about the price of that phone, you know, it is not so high, but I lost all of my information on that phone, including pictures, contacts of my friends and family, my internet accounts like google and some other social application accounts, emails and etc. Without that phone, it'll be hard to access those account since I even can't receive verify code. It's so terriable.

At that time, I was so regretful that why I was so careless to lose my phone, you know I was a person that seldom lost something, that is the first time that I lost a item so valuable. From then on, I checked my bag, my pockets when I got of the public transportation even when I left the home, I also check them over and over again.
