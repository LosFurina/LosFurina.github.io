## Practice

When't comes to a crowded place, the first one that pops up from mind must be the subway in China.

You know, I was a student studying in Hangzhou Zhejiang, it is inevitiablt to take subway from expressway station or airport to my school. To speak of, the subway is not always so crowded， it's really depends on the time and location. For example, it will be so crowded at 7am to 10 am on weekdays, in contrast, there will be not so crowded on weekends. Different subway lines are also different, line one must be the most crowdrd line amongst all the lines, because this line will across the busies street, train station and airport. but those new built lines are so spacious.

The one impressed me most must be when I was going to my company from my school, that's just happened a few month ago, that's my first internship job. I had to get up at 7 am, because I should arrive at the company before 9 am, but it would take me about one and a half hour on the subway, so getting up at 7 am is really not early. After washing up, I went to the subway station. Because I was the only one who had to go to internship job for my application of master's degree, so at that time, I just went to work alone and therefore, any of my roommates wouldn't get up at 7 am and took the subway with me together.

Regarding to the duration on the subway, that was absoultly so boring, but you know, there was actually no leisure room to stretch even take my smartphone out and watch some video, if I were fortunate enough, I could get a seat, so I can take a snap until arrive at the destination, but all the time, I had to stand  all the way.

To be honest, the suffering of taking subway must be a sort of torture. I hate that feeling, if it possible, I never wanna take the subway during morning rush hour.
