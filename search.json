In my field, when we encounter problems, such as code that won’t compile, where to find relevant information, or even when we don’t know what problems we are facing, the situations can be quite strange. This is when we really need a knowledgeable person to seek advice from, and the best one is definitely our major mentor. She is experienced enough to offer us some useful suggestions. In addition, our mentor is friendly and very patient, so when we talk to her, we feel no stress and can take it easy. For these reasons, we really like seeking help from her.\nFurthermore, the advice from our mentor is so detailed and professional. These problems are exactly difficult for beginners to find a correct solution, and she knows it clearly. Therefore, not just out of the responsibility as a teacher but also for taking care of us, she always provides guidance that not only addresses the immediate issue but also helps us understand the underlying principles, becaues no one can know everying, which improves our problem-solving skills over time.\nAs for how I feel about her, I have immense respect and gratitude. She has helped me significantly, not only with my academic research but also by making me understand that grasping the underlying principles and mechanisms of problems is more crucial than the problems themselves. Now, I am confident in facing challenges and problems without needing anyone else’s help, simply by applying what I learned from my mentor.\nKeywordsuniversity major mentor, CS, problem can’t be solved by my self sometimes, so sophisticated, patient, friendly, easy to talk, how to solve the problem in our academic research, immense, respect\n","categories":["English Study"],"tags":["IELTS","Speaking"]},{"title":"What is Bandwidth","url":"/2025/05/22/Bandwidth/","content":"云服务器带宽和流量的区别云服务器的带宽配置主要分为两种描述方式：带宽上限 和 流量上限。以下是它们的详细介绍和对比。\n\n1. 带宽上限（如 4Mbps）含义带宽表示服务器与网络连接的速率上限，单位通常为 Mbps 或 Gbps。\n示例：4Mbps 表示每秒最多传输 4 兆位数据，实际速率约为 0.5 MB&#x2F;s。\n适用场景限制峰值流量：控制服务器的峰值速率，适合需要稳定网络连接的场景。\n持续传输数据：如 HTTP 服务、流媒体等需要长时间稳定传输的应用。\n常见原因固定速率分配：云厂商为入门级套餐设定的固定带宽。\n按峰值带宽收费：更便于用户管理成本。\n计算预估流量假设每天持续使用 4Mbps 带宽，可计算月流量：\n月流量 = 4 Mbps × 3600 秒/小时 × 24 小时/天 × 30 天 ÷ 8\n\n结果约为 1.3TB&#x2F;月。\n\n2. 流量上限（如 2TB）含义流量上限是指每月可传输的数据总量（上传+下载），但不限制速率。\n适用场景弹性使用：突发性流量需求高，例如大文件下载、CDN 缓存更新。\n一次性大数据传输：短时间内需要高性能网络。\n常见原因流量套餐：按月总流量限制，而非速率。\n高性能传输：适合需要更快传输速率的应用场景。\n带宽与流量关系如果在流量限制模式下，带宽为 100Mbps，消耗 2TB 流量的理论时间：\n用时 = 2TB × 8 ÷ 100 Mbps = 44.4小时\n\n3. 带宽与流量的对比\n\n\n特性\n带宽上限（如 4Mbps）\n流量上限（如 2TB）\n\n\n\n计费模式\n按带宽固定计费\n按月流量总量计费\n\n\n适合场景\n稳定、持续的数据传输\n短时间内传输大文件或突发流量\n\n\n速度表现\n最大速率固定，无法突破限制\n理论速率无限制，依赖硬件和网络\n\n\n成本控制\n容易预估成本\n需动态监控流量\n\n\n计算复杂度\n简单，按 Mbps 使用\n复杂，需监控总流量\n\n\n\n4. 如何选择？选择带宽上限的场景需要稳定速率的服务（如网站、API 服务）。\n希望控制网络资源以限制成本。\n流量使用较少，但需要长期稳定连接。\n选择流量上限的场景流量需求波动大（如高峰访问）。\n需要传输大文件或处理批量任务。\n对突发高性能连接需求较高。5. 为什么存在两种模式？带宽模式：适合长期、低成本、稳定的服务。\n流量模式：灵活、高性能，适合突发性大流量任务。总结：根据业务需求选择合适的模式。如果依赖峰值速率，优先考虑带宽模式；如果需要灵活性或传输大数据，选择流量模式更合适。\n","categories":["Network"],"tags":["Network"]},{"title":"Challenge","url":"/2024/09/30/Challenge/","content":"TopicDescribe a challenge you faced that you thought was rather difficultYou should say:What it wasWhen and where you faced itWhy you thought it was a difficult challengeAnd explain how you felt at the time\nPracticeWhen it comes to a challenge that I am facing, I really feel this deeply and have much wannt talk about. So I’d like talk about is applying master’s degree. You know, this must be the most difficult challenge for me.\nSince the March on the last yaer, I have already prepared some work of applying, until now, it has been approximately one and a half year including now. Last year, I haven’t get my bachelor’s degree, so I was living in my university and doing some sidework of applying such as learning English and preparing the IELTS, at that time, I had to pay more attention to my final examination, so I had no enough energy to concentrate on IELTS, I just try it once on July, but I just got 6 last time. And then, the next term began, although I was so worried that I exactly can’t get enough score in IELTS, but I had to graduate first, and meanwhile, I also had to do some internship job and academic research to rich my resume and personal statement. Besides, GPA was also important for me, I must perform well on all of those I mentioned above.\nIn order to get a good GPA, when I was in Third year of university, I always staied up late to review my schoolwork for a good score in final examination fortunately, I finally got about 88 of GPA. But in the present viewm, get a good GPA might be tht easiest part. After I entered the fouth year of the university, I had to pay full attention on my graduation design, that is a part of my research experience. Maybe you can’t image how difficult about academic research, I had to understand how the model work and reproduce the sort of the art experiment. In order to get a perfect result, I even staied up late until 5 am often. Because the experiment can’t be stopped, so I had no choice but to wait, meanwhile, I studied English. When the time came to this year, I finnaly finish the academic research a few days ago.\nIn addition, it is necessary to get a 6.5 in IELTS, but from my saw, listening must by a shortage for me. And the tension is unavoidable for me in Speaking part. You know, after I decided to apply my master’s degree, I actually have no any leisure time to have a rest, I am so tired now, and sometimes I really can’t consist on.\nKeywordsApplying my master’s degree, In my university, Learning English, IELTS, Adademic research, GPA, tired, fortunate\n","categories":["English Study"],"tags":["IELTS","Speaking"]},{"title":"Confidence","url":"/2024/10/01/Confidence/","content":"Topic\n        \n            \n        \n        \n          var ap = new APlayer({\n            element: document.getElementById(\"aplayer-qlDPgEAe\"),\n            narrow: false,\n            autoplay: false,\n            showlrc: false,\n            music: {\n              title: \"Hotel Califonia\",\n              author: \"Eagle\",\n              url: \"https://ali.liweijun.top/oss/206-Hotel%20California.flac\",\n              pic: \"\",\n              lrc: \"\"\n            }\n          });\n          window.aplayers || (window.aplayers = []);\n          window.aplayers.push(ap);\n        \n\nDescribe something you did in your study&#x2F;work that has made you feel confidentYou should say:When and where it happenedWhat you didWhy it made you feel confidentAnd explain how you felt about it\nPracticeWhen it comes to a work that makes me feel so confident, the first one that I’d like to talk about is a thing which also make me hard to forget. That was once teamwork.\nWhen I was in my third year of university, there was a class called Network security and program design. You know, I am a student majoring in computer science. The teacher of this class made a homework that should be done by a team, and all of students should make their team.  That homework is designing a program which was related to network security, and meanwhile, two of classmates came to me and ask whether we could be a team, at the beginning, I was so delighted to finish this homework with a team, because I can know more classmates, and became friends with each other, so I agreeed the invitation. After a few days, all of my teammates reckon I was studied well at code programming, and recommand me to be the team leader, I also agreeed at that time. But something happened after that made me so suprised, I assign the different parts of the homewoek to thoes two, and they made sure they could finish in two week. But, after two weeks, and the homewoek deadline was closing, I asked them for their part of work, they just told me they were so busy with something else, so they had not do the homework, I was so annoied at that time. I had no choice but done all of homework by myself, and finally, I finished all brfore the deadline. You know, at that time, I even staied up late until 4 am everyday and got up at 10 am. I was so tired those day and feeling unpleaant for those two teammates.\nAlthough, those two were so unresponsible for our team, but I found I can finish the work by myself without them evne got a A in final score, to speak of, I am really fond of computer science, so I don’t think learning more is a bad thing. After I suffered that experience, I was actually confident because I knew I was energetic and powerful enough to finish my study without the help and any cooperation. Despite that I was really tired, but I was also happy to improve myself.\n","categories":["English Study"],"tags":["IELTS","Speaking"]},{"title":"Craftman","url":"/2024/09/28/CraftMan/","content":"TopicDescribe a person who likes to make things by hand (e.g. toys, furniture)You should say:Who this person isWhat he&#x2F;she makesWhy he&#x2F;she likes to make things by handAnd explain how you feel about the person\nPracticeWhen it comes to a person who enjoy making some stuffs by hands, there is exactly a person that I’d like to talk about.\nHe is an internet influencer in China, his nickname is “He tongxue”, which means “classmate He”, his last name might be He, and you know, there are a lot of followers of him including domestice platform bilibili and some international platform, including twitter and Youtube, at least, he has approximately 100,000 followers.\nThe first time that I know him is from a video made by him on that domestice video platform. He focused on making some gadgets by hands and published the processing of manufacturing on those video platforms.\nWhat impresses me most is a high technology desk maked by himself.The original purpose for making this desk is to implement a ideal product that have been canceld by Apple, that is AirPower, a stuff for wireless charging. Therefore, we will never buy it from Apple, the only way is making it by himself. This influencer wanna make a better AirPower than that idea of Apple. \nFirst of all, this desk has a height-adjustable desk legs, which can adjust different using scenarios. In order to realize wireless charging on desk, him came up a new idae, that is, when we put the phone on the desk, the wireless charging plate will move to the below of the phone automatically with a computer vision technology. Besides the wireless charging, he also integrated some else functions to this desk, like there is a mini robat that can help us pick up a glass of water, and there is also a LED screen can show some information, like time, countdown and weather. All in all, this craft is exactly interesting.\nTo speak of, I am a student majoring in the Computer Science, so when I saw this video, I dived into it immediately. I am really interested in how this desk work, so I watched this video thoroughly. \nBased on his previous video, I guess he is also a big fan of cutting-edge technology, particularly Apple products, which aligns with my own interests.

To speak of, the subway is not always so crowded， it’s really depends on the time and location. For example, it will be so crowded at 7am to 10 am on weekdays, in contrast, there will be not so crowded on weekends. Different subway lines are also different, line one must be the most crowdrd line amongst all the lines, because this line will across the busies street, train station and airport. but those new built lines are so spacious.\nThe one impressed me most must be when I was going to my company from my school, that’s just happened a few month ago, that’s my first internship job. I had to get up at 7 am, because I should arrive at the company before 9 am, but it would take me about one and a half hour on the subway, so getting up at 7 am is really not early. After washing up, I went to the subway station. Because I was the only one who had to go to internship job for my application of master’s degree, so at that time, I just went to work alone and therefore, any of my roommates wouldn’t get up at 7 am and took the subway with me together.\nRegarding to the duration on the subway, that was absoultly so boring, but you know, there was actually no leisure room to stretch even take my smartphone out and watch some video, if I were fortunate enough, I could get a seat, so I can take a snap until arrive at the destination, but all the time, I had to stand  all the way.\nTo be honest, the suffering of taking subway must be a sort of torture.

Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\nPracticeRegrading to the purpose for the development of a country, there are some disputes among the different groups of people. On the one hand, some people think achiving the economy growth is much more important. On the other hand, some of them reckon that there are also many other aspects are as matter as the economy increase. In moy opinion, I am of the point that although it is essential for the development of a country, those other sides related to people’s life should be paied more attention to.\nFirst of all, it is reasonable that some people support the government to focus on the stimulating of economy, because the revenue is essentially important for developing other aspects of one country. If a country have no enough funding, it is imangable that people’s livehood could poor. For example, the development of a city must be relied on the fundamental facilities including express way, transportation and buildings, but If there is no sufficient budget of local government, it will be impossible to improve those basic conditions. Besides, there are also many benefits that people can get from the increasing economy. For instance, there will be more job opportunities for people to select, and people can earn money easily from the local companies sinse the government own enough money to invest those local industials. It is exact that people can improve their life quality.\nOn the other hands, it is also comprehensiable that economy development is not everything, there are still some aspects can be easily overlooked, such as social justice, people’s safety and national culture. People can gain a sense of acceptance and belief from the actions of the government to make sure they can be treated equally. Only the boosting of the economy can not bring those benefits to people, it needs the efforts from governments. Additionally, with the development of one country, the environmental pollution is also a big challenge to face. For example, New York, Beijing and London are polluted as the developed industries near the downtown. It is inevitable people will be affected by poor air condition, a lot of people living here will get some disease, as the result, people will have no energy to work even move out off this city, in that case, the economy will not increase anymore.\nOverall, although the increase of economy is essentially important for a country, while administrators should not underrestimate the importance of those detailed aspests which can affect people’s life. Essentially, people are the basis for the development of a country. Therefore, this is not just a binary issue, we should have a balance development on multi-sides.\n","categories":["English Study"],"tags":["IELTS","Writing"]},{"title":"Change Bind Port of Docker

Preposition","url":"/2025/01/16/English-Preposition/","content":"介词的原理Introduction\n名词和介词在现实世界中看的着摸得见，但是介词不一样，往往抽象难以理解。\n\n牛津词典对10亿单词做出分析后，列出了英语中最常用的单词。其中最常用的30个单词中，10个就是介词。足以说明介词在英语使用中非常重要。\n\nOfficial Website\n\n据说介词这个术语来自清朝末年的语言学家马建忠老师，原话是：\n\n凡虚字用以连实字相关之义者，曰“介词”。介字云者，犹为实字之介绍耳。  \n\n\n也就是说介词是为了介绍实词而存在的，其中实词代表具体的，有意义的词，甚至是看得见摸得着的东西。与实词相对的就是虚词。\n\n在英文中，介词为：preposition，这个词本身符合[[英语构词法]]，pre表示在前的，position是位置。即前置词。介词通常是放置在名词，代词前，给他们增加附加信息的词。\n\n\n介词的附加信息：\n时间信息，空间信息，方式信息，逻辑信息（原因， 目的，对象）\n时间信息：\n我在8点前吃饭。- before\n我在8点时吃饭。- at\n我在8点后吃饭。- after\n\n\n空间信息\n我在屋子里吃饭。- in\n我在屋子外吃饭。- out\n猫在桌子上吃饭。- on\n猫在桌子下吃饭。- under\n\n\n逻辑信息：\n我为了健康吃蔬菜。- for\n我除了蔬菜什么都不吃。- except\n\n\n介词必须在其后附加其他实义词才有实际意义，这也就是为什么介词无法单独作为句子成分出现。\n\n介词的构成形式简单介词短语介词\n注意：短语介词与介词短语不是一个东西\nby way of\nat the end of\nalong with\nbecause of\nprevious to\n\n合成介词\ninto - 到···之内\nonto - 到···之上\nwithin - 在···之内\nnotwithstanding - 尽管\n\n分词介词\nincluding - 包括\nregarding - 关于\nconsidering - 考虑到；鉴于\ngiven - 考虑到；如果\n\n介词学习的误区\n通常仅具有单个或几个少量的主要含义的介词，翻译与中文可以逐个对应，因此容易掌握：\nuntil; along; except\n\n\n而常用介词，出现频率很高，因此有很多引申含义，无法与中文逐个对应。\nin !&#x3D; 里面\non !&#x3D; 上面\nwith !&#x3D; 和\n\n\n同样的，在世界各国语言中，越是常用的词，具有的引申意义就更多。\n打人，打字，打雷，打算，打住，打交道，几乎全都是不一样的意思。我们根本无法找到一个固定的意思与之对应。\nhit 42 degree, the idea hit me, hit the break, hit the road.\n这种情况下 !&#x3D; under this situation，反而是 in this situation，但是under this circumstance也是这个意思，与中文思维一致。\n\n\n因此最重要的就是：切忌把介词和中文对号入座，强行找一个翻译来对应。\n\n介词学习的诀窍一词多义\nabout ~&#x3D; on the outside of (在···外面)\n···的外围；有涉及；非核心；涉及到（关于）：\nI know something about your school.\nLet’s talk

ed：edible\n例子：vis&#x3D;&#x3D;ible&#x3D;&#x3D;, aud&#x3D;&#x3D;ible&#x3D;&#x3D;, ed&#x3D;&#x3D;ible&#x3D;&#x3D;\n**-ible**：源自古法语，最早来源于拉丁语，表示“能被……的”形容词。\n\n\n\n词根（word root）\n类似于 vis, aud, ed 的拼写，往往代表或暗示单词的核心意义。\n不同的词根可能具有同一个含义：\n希腊语：hydr（水）\n拉丁语：aqua（水）aquatic（水生的），aquarium（水族馆）\n\n\n注意：带有某词根拼写的单词并不一定与该词根的含义相关。\n例：visa，沙漠\n\n\n\n词缀（fix）\n词缀能够修饰词根以表达单词意义或属性。\n\n前缀（prefix）\n改变单词的词义，但不改变单词的词性。\n常见前缀：\nin-：否定含义\ninvisible, inaudible, inedible\n有时也表示“在里面”：\ninward, inscribe（刻写）\n\n\n类似否定前缀：\nim-: impossible\nun-: uncountable\nil-: illegal\nir-: irregular\nmis-: mislead\ndis-: dislike\nde-: dehydrate\nnon-: nonlinear\n\n\n\n\nen-：表示“使得”\nenlarge, enable\n\n\n\n\n\n后缀（suffix）\n改变词性：同样的词根加不同后缀，核心意思不变，词性改变。\nvisible -&gt; visibility（能见度）\n\n\n\n派生组合规则举例\n仅有1个词根：\n前缀 + 词根：construct\n词根 + 后缀：structure\n前缀 + 词根 + 后缀：construction\n\n\n单词包含多个前缀&#x2F;后缀：\n前缀 + 前缀 + 词根：reconstruct\n词根 + 后缀 + 后缀：structural\n前缀 + 词根 + 后缀 + 后缀：constructional\n前缀 + 前缀 + 词根 + 后缀 + 后缀 + 后缀：reconstructionally\n\n\n出现两个词根：\ngeostructure\ngeostructural\ngeostructurally\npent（五）+ a + gon（角）：pentagon\nmaintain -&gt; maintenance\ndescribe -&gt; description\n\n\n\n派生规则的特殊情况\n如果词根是一个已有的单词（通常来源于法语），一般可加 -able：\ncount -&gt; countable\nwork -&gt; workable\naccept -&gt; acceptable\nremark -&gt; remarkable\n\n\n如果词根来源于希腊&#x2F;拉丁，通常加 -ible：\ncredible, terrible, possible\n\n\n特例：\n拉丁词根 eff 在英语中只出现于 ineffable（不可描述的），而 effable 虽未被词典收录，但已被广泛使用；effible 则不存在。\n\n\n\n\n合成\n简单单词合并构词，词性多样：\nwaterfall（n.），waterproof（adj.），underwater（adj.）\noutbreak（n.），one-way（adj.），high-class（adj.）\nbeforehand（adv. 预先，事先）\nsmoke + fog &#x3D; smog\nsmoke + haze &#x3D; smaze\nsnow + ice &#x3D; snice\nweb + site &#x3D; website\nwebsite + seminar &#x3D; webinar\n\n\n派生构词与合成构词往往有同义或近义词：\nleg（读）-&gt; legible（字迹清楚）\nread -&gt; readable（语句通顺）\n\n\n\n\n混合\n更随意的合成构词：\nbrunch: breakfast + lunch\n\n\n\n\n截短\n为了简化拼读，常掐头去尾：\ntelephone -&gt; phone\nairplane -&gt; plane\nmathematics -&gt; math\nexamination -&gt; exam\napplication -&gt; app\ninfluenza -&gt; flu\nrefrigerator -&gt; fridge\n\n\n\n\n缩写\n用单词首字母组合成一个词：\nVIP: Very Important Person\nIELTS: International English Language Testing System\nTOEFL: Test of English as a Foreign Language\nMVP: Most Valuable Player\nETC: Electronic Toll Collection\n\n\n\n\n转化\n一个单词具有多个词性：\nname（v. n.）\nfine（adj. v. n.）\n\n\n\nReference\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yuGaFQMc&amp;list=PLiRHe7F8P0-1FEbOtek-V1GgLHvW8eoac&amp;index=2\n\n","categories":["English

Do you think that the positive effects of this trend outweigh negative effects?\nPracticeIt is well known that the most wild-used language across the world is English duo to some historical and practical factors. Someone may argue that this is not a good phenomenon, but from my perspective, the advantages of using English wildly are still overweigh the disadvantages.\nThe main reasons for supporting the generalization of English focus on two points. First and foremost, English can stimulate the boosting of economy of the countries since people are able to have conversation with foreign traders all around the world with the same English. For example, if a company’s financial statement is written in English, any investors from diffenet countries can understand it through English. Secondly, English is a driving force for international cooperation. According to statistic, approximate 80% information on internet is written in English such as google, twitter and any other famous websit are mainly uesd in Engish due to the convenience of English. Besides, as we all know, the most internation conferences and orgnaiszation recognize the English as the official language to record their document. In the light the these facts, people can overcome the challenges of diffence from different culture to communicate and cooperate well.\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that there are some detrimental effects on saving the varieties of local culture. With the thriving of using English as a general tool to communication, more and more young peopl may overlook that the culture of theirs is losing. For instance, some countries are implementing the policies of encourging students to learn more English to achieve globalization but neglect the learling of local languge, which absolutely will cause the culture losing.\nBased on the factors above, while there are plently of benefits from using supporting generalization of English, we should not ignort those negative effects from influx of using Englihsh. Overall, the advantages still overweigh the disadvantages, but we should face the issues from English in caution.\n","categories":["English Study"],"tags":["IELTS","Writing"]},{"title":"Get SSL Certificates","url":"/2025/05/22/Get-SSL-Certificates/","content":"1.

To what extent do the benefits of this development outweigh the problems?\nWith the development of transportation, it is becoming more and more convenient for people to purchase some stuffs products produced overseas, which is an unstopped   unstoppable trend for globalization. From the a personal view, the advantages of this phenomenon overweight overweigh the disadvantages.\nThe main reasons for supporting buying products from overseas are focusing on two points. Firstly, the people could purchase some stuffs commodities more cheaperly if they choose those from overseas. Since different countries or regions own have the different technics unique technologies and resources uniquely, so they could manufacture those products with less lower additional  extra expense like , such as transportation fees and knowledge fee costs. For that,  the final producingproduction cost could be much less lower than in other countries. For instance, withdue to the advantageous of location of Southeast Asia, the agriculture of tropical fruits is developed, the fruit from there are less expensive with and of high qualification quality.  On the other hand, for some products, overseas market offers more choices for people to select from. Therefore, people could purchase the different kinds of it by following based on their own prefer preferences. Taking the smartphone as an example, people may prefer different brands, for those who enjoy the a tidy of operation system could buy iPhone, those who are the fans of photography could choose Sony.\nIn contrast, that this is not a good news for domestic industrial industries. It is undeniable that some overseas products bring the convenience and cheap price for people, but it also will have impact on same type domestic industrials of the same type, they have to may face the challenge from foreign companies, which means some people have to face the risks of unemployment. Besides, it is also inevitable that buying products from overseas could cause more global transports, furtherly leading contributing to the more pollution of environment environmental pollution, which will degrade the air condition and so on.\nIt is there reasonable to reckon (or believe) that we are supposed to accept those importing products with caution. Although the people could receive some benefit from oversea products,  it is also necessary to develop the native industrials industries.\nExample of G\n\n\n1.   随着世界越来越国际化 (globalized), 国家之间商品的流通 (exchange) 以惊人的速度 (at an astonishing rate) 进行着. As the world is  increasingly globalized, the exchange of commodities across the border is proceeding at an  astonishing rate.\n\n\n\n\n2.   这已经激发 (sparked) 关于 “****进口商品的增加是否具有负面 **(adverse)影响”** 的争论  (controversy)  It has sparked  controversy over whether the increase in imports has adverse impacts.\n\n\n\n3.   在我看来 (from my point of view), **这一做法的优点多于缺点  From my point of  view,  this practice’s advantages outweigh its disadvantages.\n\n\n\n主体部分第一段\n\n\n\n4.   进口商品有不少好处. 第一个好处是虽然运输费用高, 但是价格仍然很有竞争力.  [大中心句] Importing goods can yield a number of  benefits.   [小中心句] The first benefit is that despite the high cost of  transportation, imports are competitively priced.\n\n\n\n5.   主要的原因是出口这些商品的国家一般都有技术和专业知识去保证这些产品质量好, 而且便宜 (affordability).  The main reason  is that the  countries that export these goods normally have technology and professional  knowledge to ensure the goods’ quality and affordability.\n\n\n\n6.   譬如, 中国擅长 (specialized in) 生产纺织品, 因此在世界上很多地方, 中国的纺织品都比当地的同等货物 (counterparts) 便宜.  For example, China  specializes in the production of textile products so China-made textile  products are cheaper than local counterparts in many parts of the world.\n\n\n\n7.   此外, 进口商品挑战国内生产商的统治地位 (dominance&#x2F;monopoly), 激化 (intensified) 竞争, 从而引起商品价格的下跌.  Besides, imported goods  have challenged domestic manufacturers’ dominance and intensified  competition, thereby prompting these manufacturers to lower product prices.\n\n\n\n8.   这对于本国的消费者也是有益的, 因为商品更便宜可以降低生活成本 (cost of living)  It is beneficial  to domestic  customers, because products are more affordable and the cost of living will  decline.\n\n\n\n主体部分第二段\n\n\n\n9.   在另外一方面, 进口商品的负面因素 (downside of importing goods is that) 过分依赖进口商品可能会导致某些国内行业的发展不够.  On the other  hand, the downside of importing goods is that the excessive reliance on imports is likely  to lead to the underdevelopment of some domestic industries.\n\n\n\n10. 譬如, 很多国家进口电脑, 导致本国制造商的破产 (bankruptcy).  For instance, many  countries import computers, resulting in domestic  manufacturers’ bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n11. 这对于发展自给自足 (self-contained)的经济是有害的, 并且可能导致大量失业.  This is  harmful&#x2F;detrimental to the development of a self-contained economy, and also likely to  trigger massive job cuts.\n\n\n\n12. 另一个问题是, 运输会造成比较严重的污染, 特别当它涉及**(involves)**空运 (air freight)的时候.  Another problem  is that transportation  may create considerable pollution, especially when it involves air freight.\n\n\n\n13. 这会降低空气质量, 也会导致一些其他的环境问题, 譬如全球变暖.  It will degrade air  quality and also lead to other environmental issues, such as global warming.\n\n\n\n结论段\n\n\n\n14. 因此, 我们可以理智地认为 **(it is therefore reasonable to think that)**进口商品的优点需要有保留地 (with caution)接受.  It is therefore  reasonable to think that the advantages of importing commodities should  be accepted with caution.\n\n\n\n15. 虽然消费者可以更便宜地 (at lower cost) 获得商品, 但是国家也需要注意发展自己的相关行业  Although customers are  able to acquire commodities at lower cost, countries also need to pay  attention to the development of their respective industries.\n\n\n\nExample of ChatGPTWith globalization, purchasing products from other countries has become increasingly common. While this trend presents some challenges, I believe that the benefits significantly outweigh the drawbacks.\nOne major advantage of this development is the increased variety of products available to consumers. Global trade allows access to goods that may not be produced locally, such as electronics, fashion, and exotic foods. For example, people in colder regions can enjoy tropical fruits from Southeast Asia, which are often of high quality and reasonably priced due to the region’s favorable climate. This broader choice enhances consumers’ quality of life by offering diverse options that might otherwise be unavailable.\nHowever, the influx of foreign products can negatively impact domestic industries. Local businesses may struggle to compete with cheaper, imported goods, leading to potential job losses and economic challenges. Additionally, the environmental impact of increased global transportation cannot be overlooked, as it contributes to pollution and climate change. Despite these issues, I believe the overall benefits, such as access to a wider range of affordable products, are more significant. Governments can also implement policies to support local industries and promote sustainable practices, mitigating the negative effects.\nIn conclusion, while buying products from other countries poses challenges, the advantages—such as greater consumer choice and affordability—are far more substantial.

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n引言: (With the increasing number of students seeking higher education) (Investment in public education by the government is a controversial issue, especially under limited budget conditions.), the debate on who should bear the cost of education has become more pressing. Some argue that students should pay for their tuition themselves rather than relying on government funding. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe a balanced approach is essential.\n正方观点: Firstly, it is reasonable to argue that the government should cover the cost of education since taxpayers already contribute to public funds. Asking them to pay additional fees would seem unfair. Additionally, if education costs are solely borne by students, many may be deprived of higher education opportunities due to financial constraints, potentially leading to a less educated workforce and higher unemployment rates.\n反方观点: Conversely, having students contribute to their tuition can enhance the quality of education. With additional funding from students, schools can hire qualified teachers and improve facilities, leading to a better learning environment. Moreover, if the government allocates fewer resources to education, it can invest in other critical areas like healthcare, infrastructure, and environmental protection, thus benefiting society as a whole.\n结论: In conclusion, while there are merits to both perspectives, it is crucial to find a middle ground. Students contributing to tuition could improve educational quality and allow the government to focus on other essential sectors. However, ensuring that education remains accessible to all is equally important. A nuanced approach that balances student contributions with government support might be the most effective solution.\n","categories":["English Study"],"tags":["IELTS","Writing"]},{"title":"Investment in the Art","url":"/2024/09/25/InvestmentArt/","content":"\n\n\nInvestment on artTitleMany countries spend a lot of money in art. Some people think investment in art is necessary, but others say money is better spent on public services and facilities. Discuss both these views and give your own opinions.\nPracticeSponsorship from the government in the arts is a controversial issue, especially under limited budget conditions. Some are of the opinion that states should invest more in the arts, while others hold the opposite viewpoint. While there are valid arguements on both side, I believe a balanced approach is essential.\nThe main reasons for supporting the more revenue should be expended on arts are focused on two points. Firstly, this policy can protect traditional culture. It is important to realize that the arts are a valid part of legenct of culture, so protecting the loss of arts has important implications to culture diversity by sponsoring people to learn about them. Second, it presents the respect for the variety of humanlity. It is inevitable that different people have different pursuit. In a conprehensive society, everyone has their own right to achieve their goals, so the government should support all fields not just some certain sides.\nHowerer, it is also reasonable that some people stand on the other side. First and foremost, not all the countries have enough revenue to spend on arts and protecting culture, so they have no choice but to prioritize some basic needs, such as public healthcare, infrustructure, and environmental management.\nMoreover, by comparing to these public welfare, the arts are luxury items for the majority of people. Therefore, it is ponitless to invest more public funds on this purpose. For example, playing piano is not general in common life. And yet, the price of a piano is not affordable. If the government wast much on it, the revenue may be insuffcient on other filelds.\nIn sight of thses facts, although the government should pay attention on social inclusion and spreading of culture, it is also vitally important to focus on public service. Hence, I believe a balanced approach is essential.\nCorrectnessSponsorship from the government in the arts is a controversial issue, especially under limited budget conditions. Some are of the opinion that states should invest more in the arts, while others hold the opposite viewpoint. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe a balanced approach is essential.\nThe main reasons for supporting increased government spending on the arts are twofold. Firstly, this policy can help preserve traditional culture. The arts are a vital part of cultural heritage, and protecting them is important for maintaining cultural diversity. By sponsoring the arts, people can learn about and appreciate various cultural forms. Secondly, investing in the arts demonstrates respect for human diversity. People have different interests and pursuits, and a comprehensive society should support all fields, not just certain ones.\nHowever, it is also reasonable for some to oppose increased spending on the arts. First and foremost, not all countries have sufficient revenue to invest in the arts and cultural preservation. As a result, they may need to prioritize basic needs such as public healthcare, infrastructure, and environmental management.\nMoreover, compared to public welfare, the arts are often seen as a luxury for most people. Investing more public funds in the arts might be viewed as unnecessary when there are pressing needs in other areas. For example, playing the piano is not a common activity for everyone, and the cost of a piano can be prohibitive. If the government spends too much on the arts, there may be insufficient funds for other essential services.\nIn light of these facts, although the government should support social inclusion and the spread of culture, it is also crucial to focus on public services.

Besides, the total average spending on visiting friends or relatives is the lowest one among three types, and the part of business was the higest before 2003 but got equal to holiday after 2005.\nFirst comparation paragraphIn 1997 (the beginning of this figure), visitors spent the most on business and the data of holiday was between business and visiting in terms of $260, $200 and $120 respectively. Over the followig five years, all of three kinds of comsumption was increasing gradually, to peaks of around $330, $270 and $220 separately. However, travellers spending suddenly got a dramatic descending during next about 3 years until 2006.\nSecond comparation paragraphFrom 2006 to 2015, the daily expenditure can be seen fro both business visitors and travellors, with fluctuating around $240 and $180. By contrast, people who were in New Zealand to see their friends and families just only spent about $80 pre day, much less than those two parts of consumption over this time period. In the final year, the figure shown on the graph illustraues the average daily spending has risen to approximately $250, $210 and $140 respctively for vacationers, businessmen and those visiting loved ones.\nSkeleton over the discourse1997 (beginning) -&gt; 2003 (the trend became changed) -&gt; 2017 (the end of graph)\nTherefore, this article is ought to be divided into 5 parts to describe.\n","categories":["English Study"],"tags":["IELTS","Writing"]},{"title":"Old Friend","url":"/2024/09/30/OldFriend/","content":"TopicDescribe an old friend you had lost touch with and got in contact with againYou should say :Who he&#x2F;she isHow you knew each otherWhy you lost contactHow you got in contact againAnd explain how you felt after getting in contact again\nPracticeWhen it comes to an untouched peroson, I’d like to talk about is my friend when we were studying at junior high school. Initically, we were not the friends, but I remembered that there was an English Speech Competition held by another school, competitors had to go that school for speeching. To speak of, I was so familar with that place since I usually went my grandma’s home on weekends. Our school was a bit far away from that school, so our master teacher wished that I could went with him and help him find that school easily. Since then, we had known each other and became friends.\nBut, you know, when we finished the senior high school entrance examination, in order to get further study in senior school, we had to choose different school, so that we each went our own way. Gradually, we lost contact each other. You knwo, at that time, especially as a student in China, parent wouldn’t allow children to use smartphone, it was hard to get in touch with through internet.\nAfter three years later, we ended up with our senior high school study, and that’s time to select our dream university, it is so happened that we chose the same university. At that time, we all had our own smartphone, and he shared his university with me through wechat, I was so astonished at that time, it is unimageable that we chose the same school. And I really can’t wait to meet with him in the university. When the term began, we arrived at school and met each other immediately. At that time, what I was thinking is that that’s must be a dream, we can be the best friends again with losing contact so long.\n","categories":["English Study"],"tags":["IELTS","Speaking"]},{"title":"How to use OpenVPN","url":"/2025/05/22/OpenVPN/","content":"OpenVPN ServerInstall OpenVPN ServerWindows1.

aboutAnd explain why you watched this movie\nPracticeWhen’t comes the topic of movie, I really have much wannt talk about. This is not just for IELTS, but also for sharing my understanding of the world i’m living.\nWhen’ comes to a movie that I watched currently and enjoy it, I’d like talk about must be Trueman’s world, as far as I know, it has another name called The Trueman Show, I know this a old movie, but it’s absolutely a classic and famous one.\nBecause this is a old movie which has been published at least 10 years ago, so there is no chance for me to watch it at cinema, I just watched it on Netflix website at my home just a month ago.\nYou know I am exactly busy with my English study and adcdemic research, so there is merely no enough leisure time left for me to play with my friends. Therefore, I just watched some movies alone, including Trueman’s world.\nThis movie is talking about a insurance staff living a life that controled by a director and and the whole life was lived for all of people in this country, even more, all of his family members are actores and actoress, the pity trueman never doubt his life was a huge lie. After he grew up, he gradually realized this world was a little weird from some actors flaws, a girl wanna tell him the truth, but unfortunately, the director stopped this mistake and kicked that girl off from this big show. But no matter how the direcotr to mix the story line, trueman finally found the entire truth of this world and finally decided out off from this huge lie and pursued him own life.\nWhy I enjoy this movie is not for its vision effects, but for its plot. I really can resonate with the main characteristic Trueman, because I am also living in a world like him. Sometimes, I really can’t distinguash what is the true life and what is fake. Especially in China. Out of some unspeakable reasons, people living in China have no chance to know some news from other medias except those demestic media company. Besides, we even can’t watch videos from YouTube, from Netflix including Trueman’s world this movie, that is so ironically that I am really living in a world like Trueman’s world, but fortunately, with some help of my major I can access those information on the international internet.\nInitially, I watched those movies just for improving my English skills, that is I believe that the best to learn English is using English in my daily life, rather than just memorizing the spelling of words, but as I watched more movies and videos like Trueman’s world, I realized that I need a further study go abroad and view this world in person.\n","categories":["English Study"],"tags":["IELTS","Speaking"]},{"title":"Park","url":"/2024/09/25/Park/","content":"TopicDescribe a public park or gardenYou should say:Where it isWhat it is likeHow often you go thereWhat you often do thereAnd explain how you feel about it\nPracticeWhen’t comes to my favorite public park, I’d like to talk about is the one located in my hometown, which is Wuhai Lake Park. It’s next to the yellow river and locates at west of the whole city, but it’a a bit far away from downtown, so if people wanna visit or play at this park, it’ll absoulutely take them some time on transportatin.\nThis park is free for all of visitors, and it’s fomous for its huge human lake, it has been built about 10 years ago, and to speak of, there is a nisland in the center of the lake, people can go across the lake to that island by taking a boat with extra fee. Sadly, I have never get that island so far. If it possible, I really wanna have a visit of that island.\nWhen I was studying at senior high school, I usually went that park with my friends about once a week. Not only just for relaxation, but also we could study at a cafe in that park. The air condition is good and what’s more, there merely is no noise, so we could enjoy that time and pay full attentin to study. Sometimes, we also went that park at night, becaure I had a astronomical telescope, we could observe the stars using that telescope. It is excatly interesting, and I’m really nostalgic for that period playing with my friends since now we really have no enough time to play together.\nkeywords:Wuhai Lake, far away from downtown, huge human lake, wild life, favorite place wanna play with friends, cafe, nostalgic for that period\n","categories":["English Study"],"tags":["IELTS","Speaking"]},{"title":"Deploy 3X-UI and Network Proxy against Network Sanction","url":"/2025/01/10/Linux-3X-UI/","content":"Introduction3X-UI can help us deploy network proxy easily, especially for those who live in district with restricted network sanction.\nInstall 3X-UIOfficial project location: 3x-ui\n1.

It’s so terriable.\nAt that time, I was so regretful that why I was so careless to lose my phone, you know I was a person that seldom lost something, that is the first time that I lost a item so valuable.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nWith globalization and the development (advancement) of transportation, it is more and more convenient for people to travel all around the world (it has become increasingly convenient for people to travel across the globe). In this condition(context), it is inevitable that human societies are able to get (reap) some benefits from thriving(flourishing) tourism. However, we cannot overlook the substantial disadvantages brought by developing tourism.(被动语态更好)\nThe implications of tourism for some countries are twofold.

Secondly (Additionally), the thriving(flourishing) of tourism is able to supply more chances for the development of stimulate the development of related industries such as food, hospitality and transportation industries. It is predictable(foreseeable) that without the leading driving force of tourism, some of those related businesses may have no living space struggle to survive in a more competitive market.\nOn the other hand, while receiving the huge bonus from tourism is undeniable, there are also some significant substantial risks to concern. One main consider is environment degradation To begin with, the management of environment will become more and more difficult for local governments since massive customers absolutely will create huge amount of garbage waste production, it is a problem to solve. If they cannot manage the garbage well, there will be more other contamination including air pollution, water pollution, and cause long-term detrimental effects on ecosystem which could lead to health problem for local people.\nIn the light of these facts, although the tourism could help some countries to earn generate more revenues and improve the life quality for local civils citizens, it is also unavoidable the tourism can cause some environmental trouble. Hence, the countries that develop the tourism should (carefully) balance both sides its benefits and drawbacks for sustainable development.\nExample of ChatGPTSocieties benefit from international tourism and business. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nWith globalization and the advancement of transportation, it has become increasingly convenient for people to travel across the globe. In this context, it is inevitable that societies can reap significant benefits from flourishing tourism. However, the substantial drawbacks associated with developing tourism should not be overlooked.\nThe impact of tourism on some countries is twofold. First and foremost, tourism is widely regarded as a powerful driver for economic growth. It directly boosts the local economy by creating job opportunities in tourism-related sectors and generating revenue from foreign tourists, which can lead to an improved standard of living and increased wealth for local residents. Additionally, the flourishing of tourism often stimulates the development of related industries such as food, hospitality, and transportation. Without the driving force of tourism, many of these businesses might struggle to survive in a competitive market.\nOn the other hand, while the economic benefits of tourism are undeniable, there are also significant risks to consider. One major concern is environmental degradation. The influx of tourists can lead to increased waste production, making waste management a growing challenge for local governments. If not properly managed, this can result in further environmental issues, including air and water pollution, which can have long-term detrimental effects on both the ecosystem and public health.\nIn light of these facts, although tourism can help some countries generate more revenue and improve the quality of life for local citizens, it is also inevitable that tourism can cause environmental challenges. Therefore, countries that develop tourism should carefully balance its benefits and drawbacks to ensure sustainable development.\n","categories":["English Study"],"tags":["IELTS","Writing"]},{"title":"TraditionalFood","url":"/2024/09/28/TraditionalFood/","content":"TopicDescribe your favourite food at a traditional festival or a special event in your countryYou should say:What it isAt which festival&#x2F;event you eat itHow it is madeAnd explain why you like it\nPracticeWhen it comes to my favorite food for tradition festivals, I’d like talk about is Traditional Chinese Rice-pudding.\nThis is a famous food that merely all of people in China’ll make and eat in Dragon Boat Festival including me.

Besides, Spanish and another language became more popular from 2000 to 2010, the distribution of other four parts are keeping stable or even less.\nOverall viewIn 2000, the table shows that Spanish was learned by the most students in this university, which is around 30%. In addition, 20% of students in this university cannot speak a second language except English. It is eaqual for the number of students speaking Franch and other language not mentioned at this research, which is about 15%. Finally, the proporation of those who regarded German as their second language and who are able to speak more than two different foreign language are the smallest.\nIn 2010, the situation remained similar to that of 2000. Spanish continued to be the most popular foreign language, with a 5% increase in its usage. The same trend was observed in the proportion of students speaking a language other than those mentioned in this research, which also increased by 5%. Additionally, the percentage of students who chose to learn German and those who could speak at least two different foreign languages remained at one-tenth. It is worth noting that the number of students speaking a different language saw a dramatic decrease, from 20% to 10%, over the course of these ten years.

This park is next to the yellow river and locates at west of the whole city, but it’a a bit far away from downtown, so if people wanna visit or play at this park, it’ll absoulutely take them some time on transportation.\nTo speak of, this park is fomous for its huge human lake, and it has been built for 10 years. The original prupoes for building this human lake is improving environment including water quality, air condition, and as a result, more and more wildlifes came and lived at here. As for now, there is a diversity of fish living in the lake. Besides, some river gulls can be seen in summer, you know, this species is very precious before the lake was built since the environment is actually bad for living. What’s more, there are also some dangerous species like snakes, I have met snakes when I was a juinor high school student, me and my friends came here for camping, when we were waking alongside the rode, a snake suddenly came up, we all haven been frightened.\nAs the environment improved, more and more people are willing come here for some activities.
